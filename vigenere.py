# Now that you have your helper functions, go ahead and write a new version of the encrypt function which uses the Vigenere cipher rather than Caesar.

# Your first step is to figure out what the function signature should say. How should it be different from the Caesar version, def encrypt(text, rot)?

# As usual, donâ€™t move on until you have tested your function against a lot of different inputs and seen the results you expect.
